# Claude Code Hooks Project Archive Summary

**Archive Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Project Status**: Archived for redesign with Go implementation

## Project Overview

This repository was created as a research and testing ground for Claude Code hooks functionality. The initial implementation used Bash/Shell scripts with some Python components to explore hook capabilities and logging mechanisms.

## What Was Built

### 1. Hook Logger System (hook-logger.sh)
- Executable bash script designed to capture all execution context when triggered as a Claude Code hook
- Logged comprehensive data including:
  - Command line arguments
  - Environment variables
  - STDIN data with JSON parsing capability
  - Working directory and process information
  - Timestamped execution logs
- Always returned exit code 0 to avoid blocking Claude Code operations

### 2. Documentation (claude-code-hooks.md)
- Comprehensive technical analysis of IndyDevDan's multi-agent observability system
- Covered architecture patterns for monitoring Claude Code agents
- Detailed hook implementation strategies across all seven lifecycle events:
  - PreToolUse / PostToolUse
  - Notification
  - UserPromptSubmit
  - Stop / SubagentStop
  - PreCompact
- Real-time visualization concepts using WebSocket streaming
- Cost-efficient AI summarization using Anthropic's Haiku model
- Performance optimization strategies for multi-agent environments

### 3. Forensic Logging Infrastructure
- Multiple variations of forensic hook loggers (forensic-hook-logger.sh, forensic-fixed.sh)
- JSON Lines (JSONL) format logging for structured data capture
- Directory structure for organized logging by date and hook type
- Captured debug data in hooks-debug/ directory with timestamps

### 4. Configuration and Utilities
- hook-config.sh for environment setup
- hook-browser.fish for Fish shell integration
- bash_command_validator_example.py showing security validation patterns
- universal-hook-logger.sh for generic logging capabilities

## Key Learnings

1. **Hook Execution Context**: Discovered what data is available to hooks during execution
2. **Non-blocking Design**: Importance of exit codes and error handling to prevent blocking Claude Code
3. **Structured Logging**: JSON Lines format proved effective for parsing hook data
4. **Security Considerations**: Need for validation and filtering of dangerous commands

## Why We're Archiving

The initial approach using Bash scripts had limitations:
- Limited error handling capabilities
- Difficulty in building robust data processing pipelines
- Shell scripting constraints for complex logic
- Need for better type safety and testing

## Next Steps (Go Implementation)

The new implementation will leverage Go's strengths:
- Strong typing and compile-time safety
- Excellent concurrency support for handling multiple hooks
- Better error handling and logging libraries
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Single binary deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Archive Contents

All original files have been preserved in the `archive/` directory:
- Original documentation and analysis
- All hook logger implementations
- Debug logs and captured data
- Configuration scripts and utilities

This archive serves as a reference for the hook system's capabilities and data structures, which will inform the Go implementation design.
