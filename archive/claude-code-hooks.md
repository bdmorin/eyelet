Claude Code Multi-Agent Observability System Architecture

## System Architecture Analysis

### Core Data Flow: One-Way Simplicity

The system implements a **one-way data flow architecture** that eliminates complexity while maximizing reliability[1][2]:

**Claude Code Agents ‚Üí Python Hook Scripts ‚Üí HTTP POST ‚Üí Bun Server ‚Üí SQLite Database ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí Vue.js Dashboard**

This architectural choice ensures data consistency and prevents the circular dependencies that plague many real-time systems[3][4].

### Technology Stack Alignment

**Backend Infrastructure:**

- **Bun Runtime**: Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime handling both HTTP and WebSocket connections[2][5]
- **SQLite with WAL Mode**: Concurrent access support for multiple agent writes[2][6]
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire backend stack[2][4]

**Frontend Technologies:**

- **Vue 3 with Composition API**: Reactive real-time updates and efficient state management[2][7][8]
- **WebSocket Integration**: Sub-second event streaming without polling[2][9][10]
- **Canvas-based Charts**: High-performance visualization for live pulse monitoring[2]

**Integration Layer:**

- **Python with Astral uv**: Fast dependency management for hook scripts[2][11][12]
- **Claude Code Hooks**: Seven distinct lifecycle events captured[4][13]


## Claude Code Hooks Implementation

### Complete Hook Coverage

The system captures all seven Claude Code lifecycle events, each serving a specific observability purpose[4][13]:


| Hook Event | Purpose | Blocking Capability | Implementation Focus |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **PreToolUse** | Tool validation \& security | ‚úÖ Can block dangerous commands | Prevents `rm -rf`, `.env` access[14] |
| **PostToolUse** | Result logging \& analysis | ‚ùå Tool already executed | Captures outputs and performance metrics[14] |
| **Notification** | User interaction tracking | ‚ùå Informational only | TTS alerts for agent attention requests[14] |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | Prompt validation \& context | ‚úÖ Can block prompts | Security filtering and context injection[4] |
| **Stop** | Session completion | ‚úÖ Can force continuation | AI-generated completion summaries[14] |
| **SubagentStop** | Subtask completion | ‚úÖ Can block stopping | Parallel task coordination[14] |
| **PreCompact** | Context management | ‚ùå Informational only | Memory optimization tracking[4] |

### Hook Configuration Architecture

The hooks are configured through `.claude/settings.json` with a sophisticated matcher system[4][13]:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash|Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "uv run .claude/hooks/send_event.py --source-app YOUR_APP --event-type PreToolUse --summarize"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```


## Real-Time Visualization Features

### Live Pulse Chart Innovation

The **Live Pulse Chart** represents a significant UI innovation for multi-agent monitoring[1][2]:

- **Session-colored bars** with unique hashing for consistent identification
- **Event type emoji overlays** for instant recognition (üîß, ‚úÖ, üîî, üõë, üë•, üì¶, üí¨)
- **Time-range selection** (1m, 3m, 5m) with appropriate data aggregation
- **Canvas-based rendering** for smooth 30fps updates without DOM performance penalties


### Advanced Filtering System

The dashboard provides sophisticated filtering capabilities[2]:

**Multi-dimensional Filtering:**

- **Source Application**: Track events from specific codebases
- **Session ID**: Monitor individual agent instances
- **Event Type**: Focus on specific lifecycle events
- **Time Range**: Historical analysis and real-time monitoring


### UI/UX Excellence

The interface demonstrates several advanced design patterns[1][2]:

**Visual Design Elements:**

- **Dual-color border system**: App identification (left border) + Session identification (right border)
- **Responsive layout**: Mobile-friendly collapsible design
- **Dark/light theme support**: Accessibility and preference accommodation
- **Smooth animations**: Fade-in effects for new events without jarring updates


## AI-Powered Summarization

### Cost-Efficient Intelligence

The system leverages **Anthropic's Haiku model** for event summarization, achieving remarkable cost efficiency[1][2]:

**Economic Performance:**

- **~\$0.20 per 1,000 events** processed
- **90% cost reduction** compared to larger models
- **Sub-second summarization** for real-time insights

**Summarization Strategy:**

```python
# Event summarization with context awareness
def summarize_event(event_data):
    prompt = f"Summarize this {event_data['event_type']} event concisely: {event_data['payload']}"
    # Uses Haiku model for fast, cheap processing
    return haiku_model.complete(prompt)
```


### Intelligent Context Extraction

The AI summarization provides human-readable insights from technical event data[1]:

**Example Transformations:**

- Raw: `{"tool_name": "Write", "file_path": "/src/components/Dashboard.vue"}`
- Summary: "Created Vue dashboard component for real-time monitoring"[1]


## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Client-Side Optimizations

The Vue.js frontend implements several performance enhancements[2]:

**Rendering Optimizations:**

- **Canvas-based charts**: Avoids DOM manipulation overhead
- **Virtual scrolling**: Handles thousands of events efficiently
- **Event limiting**: Configurable via `VITE_MAX_EVENTS_TO_DISPLAY`
- **Debounced filtering**: Prevents excessive re-renders


### Server-Side Efficiency

The Bun server architecture maximizes throughput[2][5]:

**Database Performance:**

- **SQLite WAL mode**: Concurrent reads with single-writer architecture
