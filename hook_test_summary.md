# Hook Testing Summary

**Test ID**: zebra-1181-flamingo-9995  
**Test Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Coverage**: 17/22 (77.3%)

## Results Overview

### ‚úÖ Working Hooks (17/22)
- **Bash**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **Write**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **Edit**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **MultiEdit**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **Grep**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **TodoWrite**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **WebSearch**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **WebFetch**: Both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks captured
- **Read**: PostToolUse captured (PreToolUse missing)

### ‚ùå Missing Hooks (5/22)
- **Read**: PreToolUse not captured
- **Glob**: Neither PreToolUse nor PostToolUse captured
- **LS**: Neither PreToolUse nor PostToolUse captured

### üìä Other Hook Types
These weren't triggered during our tool testing but may work in other contexts:
- UserPromptSubmit
- Notification
- Stop
- SubagentStop
- PreCompact (we know this works from earlier testing)

## Key Findings

1. **Most tools are logging correctly** - 77.3% coverage is good, showing the hook system is fundamentally working
2. **Glob and LS tools** - These tools aren't triggering hooks at all, which may be a Claude Code issue or configuration problem
3. **Read PreToolUse** - The Read tool is only logging PostToolUse, suggesting timing or configuration issues
4. **Unique identifier tracking works** - Our test ID `zebra-1181-flamingo-9995` was successfully captured in all logs

## Test Script

The test script `test_all_hooks.py` provides:
- Automatic generation of unique test identifiers
- Execution instructions for all tools
- Verification of logs with coverage report
- Easy re-running with `python test_all_hooks.py --verify <test-id>`

## Next Steps

1. Investigate why Glob and LS tools aren't triggering hooks
2. Debug the missing Read PreToolUse hook
3. Consider testing other hook types (Stop, SubagentStop, etc.) in different contexts
4. Regular testing with the script to ensure hooks remain functional
